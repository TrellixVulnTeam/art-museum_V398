# React (TypeScript) Starter Kit

### Captain's Log, REPL-date 06.23.11.59 pm:

Kenny is currently in Iceland in an RV with no Internet or Replit Access. He's downloaded all the packages, is swapping batteries on his laptop and generally being a superstar. We expect data to be uploaded in the next few days.

**Trust Kenny. He will deliver the goods.**

*(Template Jam: We've uploaded about 60% of the 81 needed Starter Kits. Please judge based on 51 / 81 Starter Kits complete by the deadline)*

### React is a “JavaScript library for building user interfaces”, while TypeScript is a “typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.” By using them together, we essentially build our UIs using a typed version of JavaScript.

The reason you might use them together would be to get the benefits of a statically typed language (TypeScript) for your UI. This means more safety and fewer bugs shipping to the front end.
